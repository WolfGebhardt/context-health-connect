```

### Privacy-First Design
- **On-device preprocessing**: Audio → MFCC features (no raw audio stored/transmitted)
- **Local-first storage**: Sensitive data encrypted on device
- **Cloud ML inference**: Only anonymized features sent to classification model
- **User control**: One-tap data export or deletion

### Battery Impact Mitigation
- **Duty-cycled sampling**: 15-second audio samples every 5 minutes
- **Intelligent GPS**: Variable frequency based on movement detection
- **Estimated impact**: <5% daily battery drain (target validated in beta)

2. **Social Connection**: Regular interaction reduces depression risk by 50% (longitudinal health studies)
3. **Noise Pollution**: Exposure >70dB increases stress hormones (occupational health research)

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

**Current PoC**: Uses simulated data only  
**Future Implementation**:
- End-to-end encryption

## 🏆 Competitive Advantage

See [COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md](./README_COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS.md) for detailed market positioning.

**Key Differentiator**: We don't compete with physiological wearables (Apple Watch, Oura, WHOOP) - we complete them by measuring the missing environmental dimension of health.

| ContextHealth Uniqueness | Competitors |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Nature time tracking via AI | ✗ Manual workout tagging only |
| Social interaction detection | ✗ No passive monitoring |
| Noise pollution tracking | ✗ Not measured |
| Context-aware recommendations | ✗ Generic goals ("close rings") |
| Research-backed environmental correlations | ✗ Limited environmental data |
